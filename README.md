# Starting the app

First of all, thank you for the opportunity to make this app, I learned a lot in the past week by building this.
Unfortunately, I had no idea how to make this into an API.  The majority of my time was spent letting two instances talk to
one another through socket.io

Despite this, I am relatively happy with how this came out.  Even if I am not considered for a position at Sezzle, I would still like to 
know how I would make this into an API.  I'm curious to see what you were looking for specifically.

## To start it

start my installing dependencies from package.json ( npm install )

### Open two terminals

In the first, go into the server directory ( cd server )
run the server, allowing multiple instances to communicate ( npm start )

In the second, start the app ( npm start )

Test it out.

Thank you for this opportunity, I would love the chance to talk with you about the creation process!
