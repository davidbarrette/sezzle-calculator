## About the app

First of all, thank you for the opportunity to make this app, I learned a lot in the past week by building this. Unfortunately, I had no idea how to make this into an API.  The majority of my time was spent letting two instances talk toone another through socket.io

Despite this, I am relatively happy with how this came out.  Even if I am not considered for a position at Sezzle, I would still like to know how I would make this into an API.  I'm curious to see methods to complete what you were looking for.

## What I would change

This app helped me to realize I need more practice with css, I can't imagine someone being happy using this as their calculator. I also know of a few bugs that should be handled better as well as some aspects of the user experience (such as loading previous equations when the user connects, not after the first equation is submitted).

Another thing I am very disappointed in is the runtime.  As the number of equations increases, the time it takes to update the UI increases as well.  I believe this comes from how I set the state of the app, but I still can't believe it takes so long.  If I had more time between classes and other obligations I would sort out the issue, but would be more than happy to talk to someone about my ideas of fixing it.

## To start it

start my installing dependencies from package.json ( npm install )

### Open two terminals

In the first, go into the server directory ( cd server )
run the server, allowing multiple instances to communicate ( npm start )

In the second, start the app ( npm start )

Test it out.

Thank you for this opportunity, I would love the chance to talk with you about the creation process!
